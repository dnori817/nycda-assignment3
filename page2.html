                  <h1>1969</h1>
                  <p>The 1969 World Series was played between the New York Mets and the Baltimore Orioles, with the Mets prevailing in five games to accomplish one of the greatest upsets in Series history, as that particular Orioles squad was considered to be one of the finest ever (and still is by some baseball pundits).

The Mets won the Series in the seventh game, after overcoming a nearly hopeless deficit in Game 6, culminating in a late-game error by Boston's first baseman Bill Buckner.
