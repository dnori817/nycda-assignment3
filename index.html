   					<h2>Mets celebrate first NL East title since 2006</h2>
   					<h4>By Mike Axisa</h4>
   					<p>Saturday afternoon, the Mets clinched their first NL East title since 2006 with a win over the Reds (NYM 10, CIN 2). This is their first trip to the postseason since that 2006 season. The long wait is over.</p>
   					<p>That has to feel pretty great for David Wright, who was only 23 when the Mets last went to the postseason in 2006. He's endured a lot of heartache and injuries waiting to get back to October.</p>
   					<p>The Mets are division champs and they're going back to the postseason. Now comes the hard part: making a deep run in October. That's the goal now.

   					<h2>deGrom to start Game 1 of NLDS for Mets</h2>
   					<h4>By Anthony DiComo / MLB.com</h4>
   					<p>NEW YORK -- The Mets' best pitcher for much of this season and Cy Young Award-caliber for most of it, Jacob deGrom has earned New York's National League Division Series Game 1 start.</p>
   					<p>Manager Terry Collins confirmed Saturday what has been obvious for weeks: deGrom, in his first full big league season, will open the Mets' first postseason series in nine years. He is 14-8 with a 2.60 ERA, 198 strikeouts and 36 walks in 187 innings, with one abbreviated outing to go on Sunday. In an encore to last summer's NL Rookie of the Year campaign, deGrom has improved in almost every major statistical category, including strikeouts, walks and hits per nine innings.
